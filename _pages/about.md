## Fanzhe Meng（孟繁哲）
A third year undergraduate student, UESTC

I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Information and Software Engineering](https://sise.uestc.edu.cn/), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China Chengdu](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). Previously, I was grateful to be an intern in the [AI Box](http://aibox.ruc.edu.cn/index.htm) laboratory of [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), where I've learned a wealth of knowledge related to LLM, NLP and recommendation systems.

🔥: **Research**: I explore the application of LLM in the field of CRS (Conversational Recommender System), and my research interest includes Large Language Models, Agent and Recommendation System.

### Short Bio
During the first two years of my college life, I was studying Java Web and Service Deployment, which made me familiar with development technologies and the use of cloud servers.
My scientific research work has experienced two failures, but I don't think this has crushed my interest and courage in researching DL. On the contrary, step-by-step exploration has cultivated my abilities to analyze problems, design experiments and use tools. I believe that proactive scientific research attitude and perseverance can enable me to handle uncertainties in scientific research work.
🏓: I like playing table tennis and watching football matches.
